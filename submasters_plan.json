  "distribution_strategy": "The document will be divided among 10 SubMasters to ensure a granular focus on extracting key findings and methodologies, as per user feedback. This approach allows for deeper dives into specific aspects of the research, from foundational concepts to detailed results and their implications. SubMaster 1 will focus on the Abstract for a concise overview. SubMaster 2 will cover the Introduction to establish context. SubMasters 3 and 4 will meticulously detail the Methodology. SubMasters 5, 6, and 7 will concentrate on the Experiments and Results, breaking them down for comprehensive extraction of findings. SubMasters 8 and 9 will synthesize the Discussion to interpret these findings. Finally, SubMaster 10 will consolidate the Conclusion to present the overarching key takeaways and contributions.",
