SubMaster 1 focuses on extracting methodologies from pages 1-10, prioritizing the Methodology and Related Work sections but also scanning other sections for relevant methodological details. SubMaster 2 focuses on extracting key findings from pages 10-21, prioritizing the Results section and summarizing the Abstract and Introduction for context. This ensures a comprehensive extraction of both methodologies and findings, with page ranges adjusted based on user feedback.",
