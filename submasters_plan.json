SubMaster 1 will handle the Abstract and Introduction, providing an overview and context. SubMaster 2 will focus on the Related Work section, identifying key prior research and methodologies. SubMaster 3 will be responsible for extracting key findings and methodologies from the entire document, as per the user's primary request, by synthesizing information from all sections. This distribution ensures that the core objective of extracting key findings and methodologies is met while also covering the foundational sections of the paper.",
