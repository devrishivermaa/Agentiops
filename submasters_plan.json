SubMaster 1 will handle the Abstract and Introduction to provide an overall summary and context. SubMaster 2 will focus on the Related Work section to extract key entities and concepts discussed in prior research. SubMaster 3 will be responsible for extracting key findings and methodologies, which are likely to be distributed across the remaining sections (though not explicitly defined in the provided section list, the prompt emphasizes these aspects). Given the limited section information, SubMaster 3 will be assigned a broad role to cover potential findings and methodologies in the unlisted sections, assuming they exist and are crucial for the GOAL.",
