SubMaster 1 will focus on the foundational aspects (Abstract and Introduction) for initial summarization. SubMaster 2 will delve into the core Methodology and Experiments, crucial for understanding how the research was conducted. SubMaster 3 will analyze the Results and Discussion to extract key findings and their implications. SubMaster 4 will be responsible for entity extraction across the entire document, ensuring all relevant entities are captured, and will also handle the Conclusion and Appendix for completeness.",
