SubMaster 1 will handle the Abstract and Introduction, focusing on the foundational aspects and the problem statement. SubMaster 2 will focus on the 'Related Work' section, which is extensive, to identify prior research and methodologies. SubMaster 3 will be responsible for extracting key findings and methodologies across the entire document, as per the user's specific request, by synthesizing information from the other sections and potentially the full text if needed. This distribution ensures that the core research questions, existing literature, and the paper's novel contributions are all addressed.",
