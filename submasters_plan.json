SubMaster 1 will handle the Abstract and Introduction to provide an overall summary and context. SubMaster 2 will focus on the Related Work section to identify existing research and methodologies. SubMaster 3 will be responsible for extracting key findings and methodologies from the remaining sections (which are not explicitly provided but are assumed to exist given the paper's nature and the goal of extracting findings). This distribution ensures that each SubMaster has a clear and manageable scope, aligning with the user's request to focus on key findings and methodologies.",
