It evaluates models on textual and visual tasks, with and without external tools, and assesses both output accuracy and the quality of generated rules. Results show that while some models match human accuracy in text-based tasks, their reasoning often relies on surface-level shortcuts. In visual tasks, accuracy drops sharply, but models still exhibit some abstract reasoning. The study concludes that accuracy alone may overestimate or underestimate AI reasoning capabilities, depending on the modality.",

It re-assesses output grid accuracies when allowing alternate formats, finding minor increases in accuracy for most models, with some exceptions. The study concludes that accepting different answer formats has a limited impact on overall results. Additionally, models sometimes produced natural-language descriptions instead of grids, which were deemed invalid. The findings suggest that strict formatting requirements may not significantly affect the evaluation of AI reasoning capabilities.",
