            "summary": "The paper investigates whether AI models can perform human-like abstract reasoning across different modalities (textual and visual) using the ConceptARC benchmark. It evaluates models based on output accuracy and the quality of generated natural-language rules, revealing that while some models match human accuracy, they often rely on surface-level shortcuts rather than intended abstractions. Visual modality performance drops sharply, but models still exhibit some abstract reasoning. The study suggests that accuracy alone may overestimate or underestimate AI reasoning capabilities, and proposes a more comprehensive evaluation framework.",
