The study finds that while some models match human accuracy in text-based tasks, their solutions often rely on surface-level shortcuts rather than intended abstractions. In visual tasks, accuracy drops sharply, but models still exhibit some abstract reasoning, suggesting that accuracy alone may overestimate or underestimate their capabilities. The authors propose a dual evaluation framework combining output accuracy and rule-level analysis to better assess abstract reasoning abilities.",

Key findings include that o3 matches or surpasses human accuracy in textual tasks with medium reasoning effort, while visual modality performance lags behind humans even with Python tools.
