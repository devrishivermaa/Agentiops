The study evaluates models based on both output accuracy and the natural-language rules they generate to explain their solutions. The results indicate that while some text-based models achieve human-level accuracy, their rules often rely on surface-level patterns rather than intended abstractions. In the visual modality, accuracy drops, but rule-level analysis suggests models still capture abstractions, though they struggle to apply them correctly, implying that accuracy alone can misrepresent abstract reasoning capabilities.",

The models' accuracy is assessed based on the correctness of their grid outputs, categorized as correct-intended, correct-unintended, and incorrect. The results indicate that o3, with medium reasoning effort on textual inputs, matches or surpasses human accuracy, while Claude and Gemini perform lower. However, in the visual modality, the models significantly lag behind human performance, even with Python tools.",
