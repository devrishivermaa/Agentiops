The study finds that while some models match human accuracy in text-based tasks, their solutions often rely on surface-level shortcuts rather than intended abstractions. In visual tasks, models show lower accuracy but still exhibit some abstract reasoning, suggesting that accuracy alone may overestimate or underestimate their capabilities. The authors propose a dual evaluation framework combining output accuracy and rule-level analysis for a more faithful assessment of abstract reasoning.",

The study finds that while some models match human accuracy in text-based tasks, their solutions often rely on surface-level shortcuts rather than intended abstractions. In visual tasks, models show lower accuracy but still exhibit some abstract reasoning, suggesting that accuracy alone may overestimate or underestimate their capabilities.

          "summary": "The conclusion section discusses error types and output grid accuracies in different experimental settings for models generating answer grids. The most common error was a mismatch between the output and ground-truth grids, including formatting issues and uneven row lengths. The study re-assessed accuracies by allowing alternate grid formats, finding minor increases in most cases, with some models showing significant improvements. The analysis concludes that accepting alternate formats does not substantially alter overall results, though natural-language descriptions of grids were deemed invalid. The study highlights the robustness of the evaluation method despite minor formatting variations.",
