The study finds that while some models match human accuracy in text-based tasks, their solutions often rely on surface-level shortcuts rather than intended abstractions. In visual tasks, accuracy drops sharply, but models still exhibit some abstract reasoning, suggesting that accuracy alone may overestimate or underestimate their capabilities. The authors propose a dual evaluation framework combining output accuracy and rule-level analysis for a more faithful assessment of abstract reasoning.",

In visual tasks, accuracy drops sharply, but models still exhibit some abstract reasoning, suggesting that accuracy alone may overestimate or underestimate their capabilities.

The study re-assessed output grids, finding that allowing alternate formats led to minor accuracy increases (e.g., Claude Sonnet 4 improved from 60.2% to 72.5%). The analysis concludes that strict formatting requirements have limited impact on overall results. Additionally, some models generated natural-language descriptions instead of grids, which were deemed invalid. The study used the ARC-Prize evaluation method for accuracy assessment.",
