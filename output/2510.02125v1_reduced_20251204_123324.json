    "summary": "This research_paper (2510.02125v1.pdf) has been analyzed across 21 pages. \nKey entities identified include: o3, ConceptARC, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude Sonnet 4, Python tools. \nPrimary keywords: textual modality, visual modality, abstract reasoning, Python tools, ConceptARC. \n\nThe paper investigates whether state-of-the-art AI models, particularly OpenAI's o3-preview, can perform human-like abstract reasoning across different modalities (textual and visual) using the ConceptARC benchmark. The study evaluates models under varying conditions, including input modality, use of external Python tools, and reasoning effort, while also analyzing the natural-language rules generated by models to assess their alignment with intended abstractions. Results show that while some models match human accuracy in text-based tasks, their rules often rely on surface-level shortcuts rat... ... The page describes a visual prompt task involving grid transformations. The task requires identifying a single transformation rule applied to three grids and then applying that rule to a test ...",
