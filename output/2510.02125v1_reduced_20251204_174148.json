    "summary": "This research_paper (2510.02125v1.pdf) has been analyzed across 21 pages. \nKey entities identified include: o3, Gemini, ConceptARC, Claude, Python tools. \nPrimary keywords: abstract reasoning, AI models, textual modality, visual modality, ConceptARC. \n\nThe paper investigates whether AI models exhibit human-like abstract reasoning across modalities using the ConceptARC benchmark. It evaluates models on text and visual tasks, with and without external tools, and analyzes both output accuracy and the rules generated to solve tasks, revealing that models often rely on surface-level shortcuts rather than intended abstractions. ... The document evaluates AI models (o3, Gemini, Claude) and humans on abstract reasoning tasks, comparing output-grid accuracy and natural-language rule generation. It assesses whether models grasp intended concepts or ex... ... The page references two research papers: one on principles of animal cognition for evaluating large language models (LLMs) and another on a dataset for relational and analogical visual reasoni...",
