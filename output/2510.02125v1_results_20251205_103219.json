It evaluates models on text and visual tasks, with and without external tools, and assesses both output accuracy and the quality of generated rules. Results show that while some models match human accuracy in text tasks, their rules often rely on surface-level patterns rather than intended abstractions. In visual tasks, accuracy drops sharply, but models still exhibit some abstract reasoning. The study concludes that accuracy alone may overestimate or underestimate AI reasoning capabilities, and proposes a more nuanced evaluation framework.",
