It evaluates models on text and visual tasks, with and without external tools, and assesses both output accuracy and the quality of natural-language rules generated. Results show that while some models match human accuracy, they often rely on surface-level shortcuts rather than intended abstractions. Visual modality performance drops sharply, but rule-level analysis reveals some models still capture intended abstractions. The study concludes that accuracy alone may overestimate or underestimate abstract reasoning capabilities.",

In visual and textual modalities, models like o3 and Gemini show varying performance gaps compared to humans, with the largest negative differences observed in CleanUp tasks. The findings suggest that while AI models perform well in simpler tasks, they lag behind human reasoning in more complex scenarios.",
