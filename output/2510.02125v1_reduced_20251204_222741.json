    "summary": "This research_paper (2510.02125v1.pdf) has been analyzed across 21 pages. \nKey entities identified include: o3, ConceptARC, Claude Sonnet 4, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Moskvichev et al. (2023). \nPrimary keywords: abstract reasoning, textual modality, visual modality, AI models, ConceptARC. \n\nThe paper investigates whether AI models, particularly OpenAI's o3-preview, perform human-like abstract reasoning across textual and visual modalities using the ConceptARC benchmark. It evaluates models' accuracy and rule-based reasoning, finding that while some models match human output accuracy, their reasoning often relies on surface-level shortcuts rather than intended abstractions, especially in visual tasks. ... The document evaluates AI models (o3, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude Sonnet 4) and humans on abstract reasoning tasks, comparing output-grid accuracy and natural-language rule generation... ... The page references two research papers: one on evaluating LLMs for transitive inference in animal cognition and another introducing the RAVEN dataset for visual reasoning tasks. Both studies ...",
