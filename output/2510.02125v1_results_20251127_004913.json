The study finds that while some models match human accuracy in text-based tasks, their solutions often rely on surface-level shortcuts rather than intended abstractions. In visual tasks, models show lower accuracy but still exhibit some abstract reasoning, suggesting that accuracy alone may overestimate or underestimate their capabilities. The authors propose a dual evaluation framework combining output accuracy and rule-level analysis for a more faithful assessment of abstract reasoning.",

In visual tasks, models show lower accuracy but still exhibit some abstract reasoning, suggesting that accuracy alone may overestimate or underestimate their capabilities. The authors ...",

The most common error type is a mismatch between the output grid and ground truth, including formatting errors and uneven row lengths. The study re-assessed output grid accuracies by allowing alternate formats, finding minor increases in accuracy for most models, with some exceptions showing significant improvements. The analysis concludes that accepting alternate formats does not substantially affect overall results, though natural-language descriptions of grids were deemed invalid.",
