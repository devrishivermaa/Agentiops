            "summary": "The paper investigates whether AI models, particularly OpenAI's o3-preview, can perform human-like abstract reasoning across different modalities (textual and visual) and under varying conditions. Using the ConceptARC benchmark, the study evaluates models' accuracy and the quality of their generated rules, revealing that while some models match human accuracy, they often rely on surface-level shortcuts rather than intended abstractions. The results suggest that accuracy alone may overestimate AI's abstract reasoning in textual tasks and underestimate it in visual tasks, highlighting the need for a more nuanced evaluation framework.",
