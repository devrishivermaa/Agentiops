    "summary": "This research_paper (2510.02125v1.pdf) has been analyzed across 21 pages. \nKey entities identified include: o3, Claude Sonnet 4, ConceptARC, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude. \nPrimary keywords: abstract reasoning, AI models, textual modality, visual modality, ConceptARC. \n\nThe paper investigates whether AI models exhibit human-like abstract reasoning across modalities using the ConceptARC benchmark. It evaluates models on text and visual tasks, with and without external tools, and analyzes their reasoning rules to assess whether they rely on intended abstractions or surface-level patterns. Results suggest that accuracy alone may overestimate or underestimate models' abstract reasoning capabilities. ... The document evaluates AI models (o3, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude Sonnet 4) and humans on abstract reasoning tasks, comparing output-grid accuracy and natural-language... ... The page references two research papers: one on principles of animal cognition applied to LLM evaluations, focusing on transitive inference, and another introducing the RAVEN dataset for relat...",
