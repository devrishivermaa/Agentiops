It evaluates models on text and visual tasks, with and without external tools, and assesses both output accuracy and the quality of generated rules. Results show that while some models match human accuracy in text tasks, their reasoning often relies on surface-level shortcuts. In visual tasks, accuracy drops, but models still exhibit some abstract reasoning. The study argues that accuracy alone may overestimate or underestimate AI's abstract reasoning capabilities.",
