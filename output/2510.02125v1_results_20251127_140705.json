The study finds that while some models match human accuracy in text-based tasks, their solutions often rely on surface-level shortcuts rather than intended abstractions. In visual tasks, accuracy drops sharply, but rule-level analysis reveals that models still capture intended abstractions, though they struggle to apply them correctly. The authors argue that accuracy alone may overestimate or underestimate abstract reasoning capabilities in different modalities and propose a more nuanced evaluation framework.",

The study finds that while some models match human accuracy in text-based tasks, their solutions often rely on surface-level shortcuts rather than intended abstractions. In visual tasks, accuracy drops sharply, but rule-level analysis reveals that models still capture intended abstractions, though they struggle to apply them correctly. The authors argue that accuracy alone may ...",

The most common error is a mismatch between output and ground-truth grids, including formatting and parsing errors. The study re-assessed output grid accuracies by allowing alternate formats, finding minor increases in accuracy for most models, with some exceptions showing significant improvements. The analysis concludes that accepting alternate formats does not substantially alter overall results, though natural-language descriptions of grids were deemed invalid. The evaluation method followed ARC-Prize standards, ensuring strict format adherence for correctness.",
