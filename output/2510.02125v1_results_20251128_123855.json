The study finds that while some models match human accuracy in text-based tasks, their solutions often rely on surface-level shortcuts rather than intended abstractions. In visual tasks, accuracy drops sharply, but rule-level analysis reveals models still capture some intended abstractions but fail to apply them correctly. The authors argue that accuracy alone may overestimate textual reasoning and underestimate visual reasoning, proposing a more nuanced evaluation framework.",

The study finds that while some models match human accuracy in text-based tasks, their solutions often rely on surface-level shortcuts rather than intended abstractions. In visual tasks, accuracy drops sharply, but rule-level analysis reveals models still capture some intended abstractions but fail to apply them correctly. The authors argue that accura...",

The most common error is a mismatch between the output and ground-truth grids, followed by parsing errors due to formatting issues or uneven row lengths. The study re-assessed accuracies by allowing alternate grid formats, finding minor increases in most cases, with some models showing significant improvements. Natural-language descriptions of grids were deemed invalid. Overall, accepting alternate formats had a limited impact on the results.",
